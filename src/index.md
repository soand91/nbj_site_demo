            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I've lived in 30 centuries at once. That's the title of an old Indonesian ad campaign, and it accurately summarizes my 20 years living in Southeast Asiaâ€”everywhere from a hut with no electricity to the towers of a megacity.</p>
            <p>Coups and failing airplane engines have given me an unflappable calm. So has founding, which is its own special class of insanity.</p>
            <p>I'm still in tech because I think AI is the most interesting technology most of us are going to see in our lifetimes. It's up to us to make it useful, and that's what excites me.</p>
            <p>Yes, I do many things at once here. If you wonder how I do it, the answer is the usual one: ruthless time management and efficiency. Time is the one thing I can't get back and I treat it that way.</p>
            <p>When I'm not working, you'll find me on hikes in the PNW, on a plane somewhere new, building Legos, reading books, or taking my kids on unforgettable adventures. We're going to see Taylor Swift next!</p>
